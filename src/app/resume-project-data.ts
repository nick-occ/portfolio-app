The application was interactive and allowed the user to filter at the state and country level and by different years.  This was a final project for a Visual Analytics course where our group won best project.',

I used GeoServer to connect to a SQL Server Spatial database to publish layers, OpenLayers to consume the OGC WMS and WFS services in a web application and Turf.JS to perform analysis operations.  Provided a detailed report where I published the technology, methods and findings.'

This tool was used for updating data for a large pipeline construction project spanning over 100 miles.  Incorporated audit tracking and role based functionality in order to control and log changes in the application.'

  name: 'Pipeline Risk Model',
  desc: 'Managed the creation of a geospatial risk model for a natural gas pipeline system spanning two states that determined which pipe segments in their system have the highest probability of failing.  I collaborated with subject matter experts to develop formulas to calculate the probabilities of failure.  Analyzed data for the calculations, ranging from a variety of factors such as pipe segment features, soil data analysis and field survey reports.'
