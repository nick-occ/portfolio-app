        With over 20 years of experience in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) field, I have built a career at the intersection of geospatial technology and data science. My work spans a wide range of technical domainsâ€”including geospatial analysis, web mapping application development, automation of GIS workflows, and the administration of enterprise GIS servers and applications.
        <br><br>
        In recent years, I have expanded my expertise into the data science space, applying advanced analytical techniques to solve complex spatial and non-spatial problems. My academic and professional experience includes machine learning, entity resolution, network science, and artificial intelligence, often integrating these approaches with geospatial data to develop innovative solutions.
